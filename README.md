# push_swap

## Description

**push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project developed as part of the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to sort a list of integers using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of allowed operations, while producing the smallest possible number of instructions.

The program takes a sequence of integers as arguments, stores them in a stack, and outputs a list of operations that will sort the stack in ascending order.
